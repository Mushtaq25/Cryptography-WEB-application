# Cryptography-WEB-application
Encryption/decryption Using 1. Caeser cipher 2. playfair cipher 3. DES cipher

This website is designed by using HTML , CSS , bootstrap and in backend Python-Django is used

To access this website you have to install Django(https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/install/) framework on your system and bootstrap(https://getbootstrap.com/)

The main code and the Algorithmn of the Following Ciphers are in the path :--
  Cryptography-Web-Application/Cryptography/views.py 
  Please GO-TO views.py and you can access all my code there
 
 Caeser cipher and playfair cipher Algorithm was designed by myself and DES cipher Algorithm the idea was copied from reference link-- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-encryption-standard-des-set-1/
